	"plan_summary": "Rewards by Harvey Nichols is your fast track pass to exclusive benefits and complimentary services. Earn 1 point for every £1 spent on harveynichols.com, in-stores and dining at any of our establishments.",
	"plan_description": "As your purchases inch you up the points ladder, you will unlock ever-increasingly spectacular rewards – think cases of premium wine or a private canape party hosted at the OXO Tower Restaurant. Our programme is the only one of its kind to offer a choice of rewards every 3 months, rather than once a year. The hardest part will be choosing which to redeem. Please note, Payment Linked Loyalty is currently not available in Harvey Nichols restaurants and online.",
