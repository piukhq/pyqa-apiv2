  Scenario Outline: Update to new email success
    Given I am a Lloyds user
    When I perform POST request to update email
    Then I see a <status_code_returned>
    And I perform POST request to update email again
    Then I see a <status_code_returned>

    Examples:
    | status_code_returned |
    | 200                  |
