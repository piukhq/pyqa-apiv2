Feature: Provide Payment Card Channel Transparency to Trusted Channels
  As a trusted channel, I want to know which channel(s) a given loyalty card has payment cards linked in
  so that users are informed which channel(s) they need to go to, to manage their payment cards.

    Given I am a squaremeal user
    When I perform POST request to add a new "<payment_card_provider>" payment card to wallet
    When I perform POST request to add trusted channel "<merchant>" loyalty card
    Then I see a 201
    When For squaremeal_user I perform get payment_account_channel_links
    Then I see a <status_code_returned>
    Then verify response of get payment account channel links for <merchant>

    Examples:
      | merchant      | status_code_returned |payment_card_provider |
