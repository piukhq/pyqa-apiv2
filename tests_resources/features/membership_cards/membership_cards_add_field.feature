@membership_card
Feature: Add a loyalty card
  As a Bink user
  I want to store a loyalty card in my wallet
  so that I can display the barcode in-store, and (if applicable) authorise the loyalty card at a later stage

  @add_field @bink_regression_api2
  Scenario Outline: Add field journey only
#    Given I am a Bink user
    When I perform POST request to add "<merchant>" membership card
    Then I see a <status_code_returned>
#    And I perform GET request to verify the "<merchant>" membership card is added to the wallet
    And verify the data stored in DB after "<journey_type>" journey for "<merchant>"
#    And I perform DELETE request to delete the "<merchant>" membership card
    Examples:
      | merchant | journey_type | status_code_returned |
      | Iceland  | Add_field    | 201                  |
      | Wasabi   | Add_field    | 201                  |

#    And I perform GET request to verify the "<merchant>" membership card is added to the wallet
    Then verify the data stored in DB after "<journey_type>" journey for "<merchant>"
#    And I perform DELETE request to delete the "<merchant>" membership card
    Examples:
