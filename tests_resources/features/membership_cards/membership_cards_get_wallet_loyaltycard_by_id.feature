Feature: View Wallet by loyalty card id
  As a Bink user
  I want to view details of single loyalty cards
  so t do not have to call multiple different endpoints



   @view_loyaltycard_by_id @bink_regression_api2
  Scenario Outline: View loyalty card by id
    Given I am in Bink channel to get b2b token
    When I perform POST token request for token type "b2b" to get access token
    And I perform POST request to add a new "<payment_card_provider>" payment account to wallet
    And I perform POST request to add and authorise "<merchant>" membership card with transactions and vouchers
    And I perform GET 'Wallet_by_card_id'
    Then I see a <status_code_returned>
    And All 'Wallet_by_card_id' fields are correctly populated for <merchant>
    And I perform DELETE request to delete the "<merchant>" membership card
    And I perform DELETE request to delete "<payment_card_provider>" the payment card

    Examples:
      | merchant      | status_code_returned|payment_card_provider|
      | Wasabi        | 200                 |master               |
      |Iceland        |200                  |master               |
