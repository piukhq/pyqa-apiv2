As a Bink user I want to view my loyalty card vouchers in my wallet
so that I am aware and have visibility of the vouchers that have been concluded with my loyalty card

  Scenario Outline: Get Loyalty card vouchers
    Given I am a Bink user
    When I perform POST request to add and authorise "<merchant>" membership card with transactions and vouchers
    And I perform GET request to view loyalty card vouchers for "<merchant>" with "<state>", "<progress_display_text>", "<current_value>", "<target_value>", "<suffix>" and "<barcode_type>"
    Then I see a <status_code_returned>
