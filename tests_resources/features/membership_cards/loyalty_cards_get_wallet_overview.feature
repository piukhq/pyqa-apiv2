Feature: Overview of wallet information
  As an API v2.0 consuming channel,
  I want to see an overview of wallet information
  so that I can display this on the front end without having to call the larger /wallet endpoint

    And I perform POST request to add a new "<payment_card_provider>" payment account to wallet
    And I perform GET 'Wallet_overview'
