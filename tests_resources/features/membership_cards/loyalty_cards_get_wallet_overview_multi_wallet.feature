Feature: View Wallets overview
  As a Bink user
  I want to view my loyalty cards in each wallet added in different channels
  so that I can see the card status is independent of other wallets

    And I perform POST request to add a new "<payment_card_provider>" payment account to wallet
    And I perform POST request to add and authorise "<merchant>" membership card with transactions and vouchers
    And I perform GET Wallet_overview
    Then I see a <status_code_returned>
    And All Wallet_overview fields are correctly populated for <merchant>
    Given I am a Lloyds user
    When I perform POST request to add a new "<payment_card_provider>" payment account to wallet
