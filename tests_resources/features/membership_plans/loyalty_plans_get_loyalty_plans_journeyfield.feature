Feature: view journey fields
  As a Bink API Consumer
  I want to view the all the fields a user is required to fill in in order to complete all supported loyalty card journeys
  so that I can display them to the user when required.

  Scenario Outline: Verify VIEW Loyalty Plans journey fields for loyalty scheme
    Given I am a Lloyds user
    When I perform GET request to view journey field for "<loyalty_scheme>"
    Then I verify the <status_code> for journey field appeared
    And I can see the journey fields of that merchant "<loyalty_scheme>"

    Examples:
      | loyalty_scheme | status_code |
      | Iceland        | 200         |
      | Wasabi         | 200         |
      | SquareMeal     | 200         |
      | Asos           | 200         |
  #    | HarveyNichols  | 200         |
