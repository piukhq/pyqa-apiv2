Feature: As a Bink API Consumer I want to view the all the fields a user is required to fill in in order to complete all supported loyalty card journeys
  so that I can display them to the user when required.

  @membership_plan @bink_regression @bmb_regression
  Scenario: VIEW Loyalty Plans journey fields
#    Given I am a Bink user
#    When I perform GET request to view all available membership plans
#    Then I can ensure the "Wasabi" plan details match with expected data
