  Scenario Outline: Get Loyalty card vouchers
    Given I am in Bink channel to get b2b token
    When I perform POST token request for token type "b2b" to get access token
    When I add membership card with transactions and vouchers for "<merchant>"
    And For bink_user I perform GET voucher for loyalty card with authorised for <merchant>
    Then I see a <status_code_returned>

    Examples:
      | merchant      | status_code_returned |
      | Viator        | 200                  |
