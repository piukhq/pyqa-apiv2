Feature: View Wallet by loyalty card id
  As a Bink user
  I want to view PLL details of single loyalty cards
  so that I do not have to call multiple different endpoints

  @wallet_loyaltycard_pll_status1 @bink_regression_api2
  Scenario Outline: Verify wallet loyalty card by id pll links for active payment account and authorised loyalty card
    Given I am in Bink channel to get b2b token
    When I perform POST token request for token type "b2b" to get access token
    And I perform POST request to add a new "<payment_card_provider>" payment account to wallet
    When I add and authorise "<merchant>" membership card
    And I perform GET Wallet_by_card_id
    Then I see a <status_code_returned>
    And I can see '<state>','<slug>' and '<description>' in PLL links for Wallet loyalty card by id
    And verify that for bink_user data stored in after pll_active journey for "<merchant>"

     Examples:
     | merchant | status_code_returned|payment_card_provider|state|slug  |description |
     | SquareMeal   | 200                 | master              |active|null |null        |
