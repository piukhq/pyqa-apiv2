Feature: Add and authorise a loyalty card into Trusted channel
  As a Trusted Channel I want to add a loyalty card into my user’s wallet, without needing to provide sensitive credential information
  so that I do not need to expose sensitive credential data within my system, and
  I can then link my user’s payment cards to their loyalty card, so my users can use PLL.

  Scenario Outline: Trusted channel adds loyalty card into wallet
    Given I am a squaremeal user
    When I perform POST request to add trusted channel "<merchant>" loyalty card
    Then I see a 201
    # And verify that for squaremeal_user data stored in after "<journey_type>" journey for "<merchant>"
    When For squaremeal_user I perform GET Wallet
    Then I see a 200
    Then Wallet fields are correctly populated for <merchant> when lc_in_only_tc
    When For squaremeal_user I perform GET Wallet_overview
    Then I see a 200
    Then Wallet_overview fields are correctly populated for <merchant> when lc_in_only_tc
    When For squaremeal_user I perform GET Wallet_by_card_id
    Then I see a 200
    Then Wallet_by_card_id fields are correctly populated for <merchant> when lc_in_only_tc
    When For squaremeal_user I perform GET transaction for loyalty card with authorised for <merchant>
    # And For squaremeal_user I perform GET balance for loyalty card with unauthorised for <merchant>
    # And For squaremeal_user I perform GET voucher for loyalty card with unauthorised for <merchant>

    Examples:
      | merchant      |journey_type      |
      | SquareMeal    | add_and_authorise|
