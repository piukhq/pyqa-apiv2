@membership_card_register @membership_cards
Feature: Register a loyalty card
  As a Bink user
  I want to add registration credentials to an existing Store card,
  so that I can register the loyalty card with the merchant and enable the Bink functionality on the loyalty card

  @register_field @bink_regression_api2
  Scenario Outline: Register field journey only
    Given I am in Bink channel to get b2b token
    When I perform POST token request for token type "b2b" to get access token
    And I perform POST request to add <merchant> membership card before registration_success register
    And I perform PUT request to register "<merchant>" above wallet only membership card
    Then I see a <status_code_returned>
    And verify that for bink_user data stored in after "<journey_type>" journey for "<merchant>"

    Examples:
      | merchant | status_code_returned | journey_type   |
      | Iceland  | 202                  | register_field |
