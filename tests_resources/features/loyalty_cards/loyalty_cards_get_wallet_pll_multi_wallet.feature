Feature: View multi wallet pll
  As a Bink user
  I want to see the Status of the PLL Link between a given loyalty card and payment card in my given wallet
  so that I fully understand the state of my wallet, independent of what is linked/unlinked in other wallets

  @multi_wallet_pll_status1 @sandbox_regression
  Scenario Outline: Verify pll links for active payment account and authorised loyalty card for multi wallets
    Given I am in Bink channel to get b2b token
    When I perform POST token request for token type "b2b" to get access token
    And I perform POST request to add a new "<payment_card_provider>" payment account to wallet
    And I perform POST request to add and authorise "<merchant>" membership card with transactions and vouchers
    When I am in Bink channel to get b2b token for second user
    And I perform POST token request for token type "b2b" to get access token for second user
    And I perform POST request to add existing payment card "<payment_card_provider>" to second wallet
    And I perform POST request to add and authorise "<merchant>" membership card with transactions and vouchers
    And For bink_user I perform GET Wallet
    Then I see a <status_code_returned>
    And I can see '<state>','<slug>' and '<description>' for loyalty card PLL links in the Wallet
    And I can see '<state>','<slug>' and '<description>' for payment accounts PLL links in the Wallet
    When For bink_user2 I perform GET Wallet
    Then I see a <status_code_returned>
    And I can see '<state>','<slug>' and '<description>' for loyalty card PLL links in the Wallet
    And I can see '<state>','<slug>' and '<description>' for payment accounts PLL links in the Wallet

     Examples:
     | merchant | status_code_returned|payment_card_provider|state|slug                     |description |
     | Wasabi   | 200                 | master              |active|null                    |null        |
