  As a Bink user
  I want to see the Status of the PLL Link between a given loyalty card and payment card in my given wallet
  so that I fully understand the state of my wallet, independent of what is linked/unlinked in other wallets


  Scenario Outline: Verify pll links for active payment account and authorised loyalty card for multi wallets
    Given I am a halifax user
    When I perform POST request to add a new "<payment_card_provider>" payment account to wallet
    And I perform POST request to add and authorise "<merchant>" membership card with transactions and vouchers
    Given I am a Lloyds user
    When I perform POST request to add existing payment card "<payment_card_provider>" to second wallet
    And I perform POST request to add and authorise "<merchant>" membership card with transactions and vouchers
    And For halifax_user I perform GET Wallet
    Then I see a <status_code_returned>
    And I can see '<state>','<slug>' and '<description>' for loyalty card PLL links in the Wallet
    And I can see '<state>','<slug>' and '<description>' for payment accounts PLL links in the Wallet
    When For lloyds_user I perform GET Wallet
    Then I see a <status_code_returned>
    And I can see '<state>','<slug>' and '<description>' for loyalty card PLL links in the Wallet
    And I can see '<state>','<slug>' and '<description>' for payment accounts PLL links in the Wallet
