  Scenario Outline: Add and authorise field journey
    Given I am a bos user
    When I add and authorise "<merchant>" membership card
    Then I see a <status_code_returned>
    And verify that for bos_user data stored in after "<journey_type>" journey for "<merchant>"

    Examples:
      | merchant      | status_code_returned | journey_type      |
      | SquareMeal    | 202                  | add_and_authorise |
